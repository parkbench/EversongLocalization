		<h3>About Eversong</h3>
		<p>Eversong is a simple yet powerful app. Its main functionality is to remember a good song when you listen to it on the iPhone or iPad Music app. It automatically detects the song including the artwork from your music library. Then you can press the button "Remember this Song" and an entry in your history of songs is created.</p>
		<h3>Gestures</h3>
		<p>In the main screen you can use gestures to control the playback. If there's no song playing, a <strong>long tap</strong> anywhere on the screen creates a random playlists and starts playing. If you <strong>swipe left or right</strong>, the next respectively previous song is played. A <strong>short tap</strong> pauses the playback and if you <strong>swipe down</strong> the playback stops. And if you swipe up, you are switching to the Music app.</p>
		<h3>Link to Evernote</h3>
		<p>Furthermore you can connect Eversong to <a href="itms-apps://itunes.com/apps/Evernote/Evernote">Evernote</a> and create a note of a song there. You only have to authorize Eversong to create notes. To do so click on "Link to Evernote" in the settings. Various aspects of the note can be configured and there's an option to post notes automatically to Evernote.</p>
